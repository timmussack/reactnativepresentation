### What is Expo?

> React Native CLI does offer more customization and flexibility.

### How to get started
> Install Expo CLI globally

  - npm install expo-cli -g

> Create Expo project

  - expo init <your_app_name>

  - Choose "managed" workflow for a pure JS project

  - The other option is a "bare" workflow

> Open Expo project in VS Code

  - npm start

> Install Expo Go on your mobile device from app store

  - Load QR code into Expo Go (camera on iPhone, in app on Android)
