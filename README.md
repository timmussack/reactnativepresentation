# React Native & Expo Go

## What is React Native?
> Framework for building native mobile apps using JavaScript

> Both iOS & Android apps can be created

## Benefits of React Native
> Companies don't have to hire iOS (Swift, Obj-C) or Android (Java, Kotlin) experts

> The web development team can maintain mobile code base

> Great documentation
 - https://reactnative.dev/

## Apps that were built with React Native
> FaceBook, Instagram, Pinterest, Skype, Uber Eats

### What is Expo?
> Framework that works with React Native and makes the dev process less complicated.

> You don't have to use Expo. You can use the React Native CLI but this requires some iOS & Android specific knowledge.

> React Native CLI does offer more customization and flexibility.

### How to get started
> Install Expo CLI globally

  - npm install expo-cli -g

> Create Expo project

  - npm start

> Install Expo Go on your mobile device from app store

  - Load QR code into Expo Go (camera on iPhone, in app on Android)
